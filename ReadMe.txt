This is the publicly available GitHub respository accompanying the manuscript by Winter et al. entitled "A landscape epidemiological approach for predicting chronic wasting disease: A case study in Virginia, US." Commented lines are code written in original scripts for actual data and can therefore be disregarded for review purposes.

Script 1 of the series entitled "Landscape_Data_Preparation.R" is provided for transparency. Reviewers are encouraged to start on Script 2 entitled "Hypervolume_Creation.R". Following in sequential order should work with updated installed packages.

Sequence of scripts:
  1. Landscape_Data_Preparation.R
  2. Hypervolume_Creation.R
  3. Hypervolume_Binary_Evaluations.R
  4. Hypervolume_Continuous_Evaluations.R
  5. Hypervolume_Uncertainty.R

All scripts were tested and corrected for incompatibilities in R package updates as of 09 June 2021.

As outlined in the data accessibility section of the manuscript, in this repository contains sample code and artifical epidemiological data due to privacy restrictions associated with the real CWD data. We encourage all requests for raw data to be sent to the appropriate channels mentioned in our statement.
